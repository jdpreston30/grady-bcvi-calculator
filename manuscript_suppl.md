Purpose: Stroke risk correlates with the Biffl grading system in blunt cerebrovascular injury (BCVI). Although anti-thrombotic therapy is the mainstay of stroke prevention, no point-of-care clinical decision-support tool exists to guide timing for therapy. We sought to develop an interactive online calculator that incorporates patient-specific demographic and injury characteristics to estimate stroke risk and risk reduction with anti-thrombotic (AT) administration. 
Methods: Data from BCVI patients (n=1,197) at a Level I Trauma Center were retrospectively collected. Six machine learning methods were employed to predict stroke risk with and without AT therapy. and AT therapy risk reduction. Class imbalance was addressed using downsampling and/or class weighting. Model performance was assessed using 10-fold cross-validation. The model was implemented as an R-based Shiny online application. 
Results: Stroke rate among the population was 4%, and the strongest predictors for stroke were the greatest Biffl grade of carotid (aOR [95%CI]=2.02 [1.62–2.53]) and vertebral injuries (1.44 [1.18–1.77]). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model outperformed all others, achieving 69% [67%–71%] sensitivity and 75% [70%–77%] specificity for stroke prediction, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80 [0.79–0.81]. This model was integrated into an publicly available, interactive online tool (https://grady-bcvi-calc.shinyapps.io/calculator/), where patient demographic and injury characteristics can be used to compute baseline stroke risk and estimate stroke risk with AT. risk reduction with AT.
Conclusion: We identified key stroke risk factors and developed a predictive model for personalized risk assessment in BCVI patients. We developed and evaluated a preliminary predictive model for personalized stroke risk assessment in patients with BCVI using key risk factors. The integration of patient-specific risk-benefit assessments into clinical decision-making could will inform the optimal timing of optimize AT initiation and reduce variability in AT therapy. External validation is warranted to optimize prepare this tool for broad clinical applicability.

Due to advances in both diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, stroke incidence in blunt cerebrovascular injury (BCVI) patients has decreased to 1-8.8% in the last three decades [1–3]. The Biffl/Denver grading scale is a five-tier classification system that stratifies BCVI based on angiographic findings and guides treatment decisions. Grade I injuries demonstrate arterial wall irregularities or dissection with less than a 25% luminal narrowing, while Grade II injuries show dissection or intramural hematoma with 25% or greater luminal narrowing, Grade III injuries represent pseudoaneurysm formation and Grade IV indicates vessel occlusion. Grade V injuries, the most severe, involves vessel transection with free extravasation of contrast. This classification system has become the standard framework for BCVI diagnosis and management in the United States and has been validated across multiple trauma centers. The likelihood of stroke correlates with the Biffl or Denver grading system in BCVI, where higher-grade injuries significantly increase the risk for post-injury cerebrovascular events in both carotid and vertebral injuries [2,4,5]. As a result, current practice management guidelines recommend grade-based treatment strategies [4,6,7]. With more universal screening and the increased diagnostic accuracy of computed tomography, the relationship between demographics, injury grade, injury characteristics, and stroke risk warrants further investigation [8–10]. Recent studies show that patients with multiple BCVIs have a higher likelihood of stroke compared to those with single-vessel injuries [2,11,12] and that bilateral injuries may also incur an increased stroke risk [13]. Other potential risk factors, such as hypotension on admission, higher injury severity score, and increased age, may also augment stroke risk [1,2,14].
Anti-thrombotic (AT) therapy, particularly aspirin, remains a cornerstone of BCVI management and has demonstrated proven efficacy in stroke prevention in patients with BCVI [4,6,7]. Although AT therapy is a mainstay of stroke prevention, no point-of-care clinical decision-support tool exists to guide, inform, and optimize optimal timing for AT therapy. Information regarding how patient-specific demographics and injury characteristics interrelate to impact stroke risk will could allow for more sensitive risk stratification of BCVI patients and further personalized treatment strategies. Thus, we sought to develop a prototype interactive online calculator that incorporates patient-specific demographics and injury characteristics to estimate stroke risk and risk reduction with and without AT administration. 
METHODS
Study Design and Data Collection
This study builds upon a previous cohort, incorporating 263 additional patients. Please see Wagner et al. [12] for full details and findings from the preliminary cohort. After obtaining IRB approval, a retrospective cohort review was performed of the trauma registry at our American College of Surgeons verified Level I Trauma Center between January 1st, 2016 and December 31st, 2024. Patients identified to have BCVI during this period were included. The electronic medical record was then queried for data on patient demographics, injury location and grade, associated injuries, neurologic deficits, hospitalization details, timing of antiplatelet/anticoagulation, and mortality. Patients who expired in the emergency department and patients younger than 12 years old were excluded from the study. 
Data Preparation
The full pipeline used for data preparation, as well as the statistical analyses, model training and testing, and the online tool development described in subsequent sections, can be found in detail on the associated GitHub repository (https://github.com/jdpreston30/grady-bcvi-calculator).  Data were prepared, structured, and pre-processed with the following considerations:
  The use of aspirin (ASA) or anticoagulant (AC) therapy was consolidated into a single variable (“AT”). For stroke patients, AT status was determined by their pre-stroke AT regimen. 
  In cases where there was more than one injury in each laterality and vessel, the maximum grade injury within each segment was retained for analysis. Based on this, a variable for each vessel was created representing the maximum grade of injury in any segment in each laterality. Finally, maximum carotid and vertebral artery injury grade variables were created based on these, which represented the maximum injury grade in either laterality of the vessel. The basilar artery was treated as a unique, laterality-independent segment of the vertebral artery when computing maximum vertebral artery grades. 
  A variable was created representing multifocal injuries, which were defined as injuries affecting more than one segment of a given lateralized artery, whether contiguous or non-contiguous. 
  For the purposes of a preliminary and exploratory analysis, the sum of total carotid and vertebral artery injuries, irrespective of laterality or segment, was taken to create a variable representing total carotid and vertebral BCVIs. Importantly, if a patient had two injuries within a single segment, each injury was counted individually toward this variable.
Univariate and Multivariable Analysis of Stroke Risk Factors
All univariate analyses of stroke risk factors were performed using the TernTablesR [15] package for R, which entailed the automated calculation of odds ratios and/or p-values using chi-squared, Fisher’s exact, and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests as appropriate. For multivariable analysis of stroke risk factors, bidirectional stepwise variable selection using the MASS [16] package in R was performed on a full model consisting of potentially important variables from the univariate analysis, along with other clinically relevant variables; in total, these included both binary/categorical variables (AT provision, bilateral carotid and/or vertebral artery BCVI, presence of multifocal carotid and/or vertebral artery injury, sex, presence of concomitant carotid and vertebral artery BCVIs, sex, race) and continuous/ordinal variables (number of multifocal carotid and/or vertebral artery injuries, maximum carotid and/or vertebral artery injury grade, injury severity score [ISS], Glascow Coma Score [GCS], body mass index [BMI], age). This resulted in a best-fit model that consisted of the maximum carotid Biffl grade, the maximum vertebral Biffl grade, and AT provision, allowing for the computation of adjusted odds ratios for these three variables.
Machine Learning Modeling
Comprehensive modeling details can be found in the Supplementary Methods and the modeling pipeline (https://github.com/jdpreston30/grady-bcvi-calculator). Briefly, machine learning models were systematically evaluated for stroke prediction accuracy using repeated 10-fold cross-validation across multiple sampling techniques (weighting, downsampling, combined, unweighted). Training was performed on both a “simplified” dataset, which included only the maximum vertebral and carotid injury grades and no laterality specification, and a “complete” dataset, wherein the maximum injury grade for the left and right vertebral arteries, the basilar artery, and the left and right carotid arteries were included. We chose this approach to (A) account for potential hidden structures in the dataset (e.g., whether bilateral injuries increase stroke risk in certain populations or injury patterns) while (B) testing simplified versions of the dataset with fewer degrees of freedom to mitigate overfitting. Six models were tested, including a generalized additive model (GAM), gradient boosting machine (GBM), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), multilayer perceptron (MLP), Bayesian logistic regression (BLR), and support vector machine (SVM). Interaction terms between age and key variables were explicitly specified for LASSO, GAM, and BLR, as these methods were unable to capture interactions between variables as the other methods could implicitly. Model performance (sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating characteristic area under the curve [ROC AUC]) was computed on held-out folds during repeated CV and summarized as the average across all folds and repeats. The ROC AUC was calculated using the pROC [17] package as the average across all folds and repeats; however, the curve generated by this package represented a pooled curve from all held-out predictions during repeated CV rather than an “average” curve.
Performance Evaluation and Model Selection
A realistic performance assessment was performed using the held-out dataset during 10-fold CV as opposed to the internal performance on training datasets. Metrics of interest included sensitivity, specificity, Youden’s J statistic (sensitivity + specificity - 1), and ROC AUC. The top-performing iteration for each method was examined, as well as the overall performance of each method compared to the others. For the manuscript, we present the results from the best-performing iteration of each model. However, a comprehensive comparison of the performance of all methods, including sampling, weighting, and dataset iterations, is presented in Supplementary Table 3 Methods. A finalized model was chosen primarily based on maximizing Youden’s J, although model simplicity and interpretability, as well as ROC AUC, were also considered. It is worth noting that a preliminary analysis was conducted using the same process described above, but with a dataset that included additional variables regarding the presence of bilateral injuries and the total number of injuries. The addition of these variables offered no advantage in model performance; therefore, we focused our subsequent analyses on the datasets without these extra variables.
Model Implementation and Online Tool Development
Once selected, the finalized model underwent Platt scaling to calibrate risk estimates properly and account for the inflated risk assessments that resulted from downsampling and/or weighting. Further details on Platt scaling are described by Huang et al. [18]. Next, the model was embedded into an R-based Shiny application. The user interface was designed to accommodate any possible combination of patient demographics and injury characteristics, with outputs including risk estimates with and without AT administration. Once developed, the model was deployed using Shiny and made available on the internet.

RESULTS
During the study period, 1,197 trauma patients with BCVI were managed at our institution. There was a total of 654 carotid and 1700 vertebral BCVIs. The breakdown of injury grades included 338 grade I, 188 grade II, 87 grade III, 40 grade IV, and one grade V carotid injuries, and 748 grade I, 421 grade II, 85 grade III, 434 grade IV, and 12 grade V vertebral injuries. A total of fifty-four patients (4%) were diagnosed with stroke in the setting of BCVI, either on admission or during their hospital stay. Of those, five patients presented with stroke symptoms. Demographics and injury characteristics for the cohort are provided in Table 1. 
We first applied a univariate analysis to stroke risk factors among BCVI patients. This revealed that among patients with vertebral BCVI, concomitant carotid BCVI, injury grade, ISS, and GCS were all associated with increased stroke risk. Among patients with carotid BCVI, injury grade was the only significant univariate predictor of stroke risk (Supplementary Table 1). Following this, we applied bidirectional stepwise variable selection, enabling an adjusted multivariable analysis. This yielded carotid Biffl grade, vertebral Biffl grade, and AT provision as selected variables. Following adjustment in this multivariable model, the odds of stroke more than doubled for each 1-grade increase in carotid Biffl grade (aOR = 2.02 [1.62–2.53], p < 0.001) and increased by 44% (aOR = 1.44 [1.18–1.77], p < 0.001) per 1-grade increase in vertebral Biffl grade, assuming other variables remain constant. Meanwhile, AT provision markedly was associated with decreased the risk of stroke (aOR = 0.19 [0.10–0.35], p < 0.001) (Supplementary Table 2). 
We then turned our attention to experimenting with six individual machine learning techniques (Fig. 1A). We examined how downsampling, class weighting, and the addition of datapoints with detailed injury characteristics affected the overall discriminatory ability. Notably, the addition of extra data regarding the total number of injuries or the presence of bilateral injuries did not affect the performance of any of the models (data not shown). Similarly, downsampling strategies to address class imbalance were superior to class weighting, except in cases when downsampling was not possible (i.e., LASSO). When examining the performance of individual methods, LASSO was superior to all other models, achieving the maximum Youden’s J (0.45), with a sensitivity of 69% [67%–71%] and specificity of 75% [70%–77%]. Ranked based on Youden’s J, SVM was the second-best-performing model, followed by BLR, GAM, GBM, and lastly MLP (Table 2). When comparing the individual ROC curves of the methods (Fig. 1B), LASSO achieved the greatest ROC AUC at 0.80 [0.79–0.81]. However, all models still demonstrated discriminatory ability for stroke prediction, with 0.71 [0.48–0.96] being the lowest ROC AUC of any model (GBM).
The final variables selected by the LASSO model included AT provision (AT), maximum carotid (C_max) Biffl grade, maximum vertebral (V_max) Biffl grade, and age in years (Age), with coefficients and terms displayed in the following equation:
logit(P_stroke )=0.77-1.14×AT+0.5×C_max+0.005×(Age×V_max )
Of note, the interaction term Age×V_max was selected by LASSO over Age and V_max as standalone predictors. The stroke risk from this model was then computed as follows, then calibrated using Platt scaling: 
P_stroke=  1/(1+e^(-logit) )
logit(P_calibrated )=-6.45+ 6.79×P_stroke

A full comparison of the performance of all method, sampling, weighting, and dataset iterations can be found in Supplementary Table 3, and a pre- and post-Platt scaling calibration plot for the LASSO model is available in Supplementary Figure 1. Model-based risk stratification yielded meaningful separation, with observed stroke rates ranging from ~1% in the low-risk group to 20% in the high-risk group (Supplementary Table 4).
The LASSO model was then integrated into an interactive online tool (Fig. 2A). The user interface of this tool allows for the entry of injury characteristics, including maximum lateralized vertebral, basilar, and carotid injury grades, as well as patient age. Following the entry of these variables, a printed output and plot provide a personalized baseline stroke risk for the patient, the stroke risk with AT provision, and the associated potential risk reduction with AT (Fig. 2B). The online tool is published online and accessible via the link and QR code printed in Fig. 2C.
In the creation of our model, adherence to institutional AT administration guidelines for BCVI were investigated. Patients at our institution with BCVI, regardless of injury grade, should receive antithrombotic therapy when clinically appropriate as part of their management. A total of 416 patients (34.8%) did not receive AT therapy for their BCVI during their hospitalization. Of the 54 52 patients who developed stroke, 35 did not receive AT therapy prior to their stroke diagnosis (Fig. 3). Of these 35, five presented with stroke symptoms. Eight patients had their AT therapy held per the request of consulting services secondary to an upcoming spinal operation or spinal imaging. Eleven patients had an evolving intracranial hemorrhage that prevented AT administration. Seven patients did not receive CTA Neck imaging on presentation: three met criteria but did not undergo imaging until they developed stroke symptoms, while four did not meet criteria based on their injury pattern or mechanism. One patient’s AT therapy was held for ongoing intrabdominal bleeding, and three patients did not receive AT therapy due to a missed recommendation or delay in consultation for BCVI management. The remaining seventeen patients received AT therapy before the diagnosis of stroke, either upon diagnosis of BCVI (11 patients) or as soon as clinically stable (six patients). Within the stroke cohort, patients who received AT therapy pre-stroke (n = 17) had longer time from admission to onset of stroke symptoms compared to those who did not receive AT therapy prior to their stroke diagnosis (183h vs. 30h; p < 0.001) (Table 3). The most common dosage of AT therapy within the stroke cohort was 81 mg ASA (71%) followed by ASA 325 mg (17%) (Table 3).

DISCUSSION
Although institutional approaches to the diagnosis and management of BCVI may vary, AT therapy remains a fundamental part of the prevention of post-injury ischemic events. Patients with BCVI often present with polytrauma, including traumatic brain injury and solid organ injury, which can complicate decision-making regarding the selection and timing of AT therapy. This tool was created to help provide guidance and personalized stroke risk estimates with and without AT therapy stroke risk reduction estimates to for patients who may otherwise be at higher risk for bleeding complications with AT therapy. Effective stroke prevention can significantly impact a patient’s quality of life while reducing healthcare expenditures associated with extended hospitalization, prolonged ventilation, and immobility-related complications.
Established clinical guidelines for the treatment of BCVI incorporate both anticoagulants (i.e., heparin) and antiplatelet agents (primarily aspirin) as evidence-based approaches for post-injury stroke risk reduction [6]. In BCVI, antiplatelet therapy demonstrates lower stroke rates compared to anticoagulation [20,21], as well as significantly lower rates of bleeding complications [20]. These findings support a clinical preference for aspirin or other antiplatelet agents over anticoagulants at some centers. Nevertheless, some institutions advocate for the use of anticoagulation for high-grade injuries, contending that the stroke prevention benefits, as well as the adjustable dosing of heparin infusions and their reversibility, justify the bleeding risks [21]. The use of heparin drip protocols for anticoagulation enables close monitoring of bleeding risks with serial CT imaging and slow titration to the desired optimal dose, which is a critical consideration in patients with high-grade BCVI and concomitant traumatic brain injury and/or high-grade solid organ injury. Current literature lacks a clear consensus regarding timing for initiating or resuming antithrombotic therapy following solid organ or traumatic brain injury; however, recent literature shows no increased risk of bleeding or worsening of traumatic brain injury with the early initiation of oral anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy [22–25]. The stroke risk reduction of AT therapy previously reported was also seen within our study population, though the retrospective nature of our data does not directly support causal inference. Furthermore, patients receiving pre-stroke AT therapy experienced longer intervals between presentation and stroke onset compared to those treated post-stroke (Table 3).
The variables selected by the model that best fit our patient population included AT provision, maximum carotid grade, and age × maximum vertebral grade. This highlights a potential interaction between age and maximum vertebral grade, which has not previously been described in BCVI literature. Our model showed that as age and grade of vertebral artery injury increased, the risk of stroke also increased. As we age, the atherosclerotic burden of our cerebral vessels increases. Patients with a high burden of atherosclerotic disease in their carotid arteries may rely more heavily on collateral blood flow through their vertebral arteries for adequate cerebral perfusion through the circle of Willis. Due to the vertebral arteries' small caliber, intimal injuries may be more likely to lead to grade 4 Biffl injuries and further compromise posterior circulatory flow, leading to increased stroke risk in older individuals. Further investigation through multi-center studies is warranted to assess if older patients with vertebral artery injuries are at higher risk for stroke after BCVI. While older adults may be higher risk candidates for early initiation of AT therapy following BCVI, our findings argue that AT therapy may be even more efficacious in this population than younger patients, especially in older adults with vertebral BCVIs. Models like the one presented in this manuscript may provide tailored guidance on the importance of early AT therapy initiation in this subset of patients. 
Several important limitations must be considered regarding the dataset used for developing the risk calculator. First, this is a retrospective, single-institution analysis for which the study design itself has limitations. Next, considerable variability exists among patient populations and protocols regarding the management of BCVI across institutions. For the purpose of our study, we also assumed all strokes experienced within this population were attributable to BCVI; however, these strokes could have resulted from a variety of factors, i.e., atrial fibrillation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Furthermore, the widespread use of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapies in the general population may have impacted the stroke risk of this patient population. Pre-admission medication reconciliations were not reliably obtained across our patient cohort, and coagulation labs were not routinely performed at presentation for a substantial number of patients. This missing data hindered our ability to fully assess the impact of pre-existing antithrombotic therapy on stroke risk in BCVI. In addition, of the 52 patients who developed stroke after BCVI, five patients presented to the hospital with stroke. Due to the limited sample size of the stroke cohort, these patients were included in the AT timing analysis and could affect the overall effect size estimation of potential stroke risk reduction with AT therapy. Lastly, to preserve the full training dataset, all antithrombotic therapies were consolidated into a single binary variable, rather than examining specific aspirin doses or comparing aspirin to heparin. While this approach allowed for a simplified analytical method and the preservation of the full dataset, it necessarily sacrificed some granularity and may have obscured treatment-specific differences in stroke prevention. However, recent work….
Additionally, several statistical and methodological limitations must be acknowledged. First, this study is limited by its small sample size of stroke patients, despite being conducted at a high-volume trauma center in a major metropolitan area. This limitation was evident in the reliance on class weighting and downsampling to account for the severe class imbalance, in the dataset of strokes to non-stroke patients  and on repeated cross-validation over split-sample validation given the insufficient number of events to allow for a protected holdout set. Future iterations of the modeling pipelines and risk calculator will focus on expanding the training dataset to include larger sample sizes, thereby allowing for a more comprehensive characterization of the minority class (stroke patients) in the dataset. Moreover, future models will experiment with alternative methods for addressing class imbalance, such as oversampling, synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), and decision threshold calibration. Secondly, the class imbalance mentioned above and the downsampling techniques applied may have resulted in overfitting of models and exaggerated risk estimates. While we attempted to account for this in using Platt scaling for risk estimate calibration, it is still possible that the risk estimates produced by our final model are not fully accurate. Finally, because the training dataset included patients aged 12 to 97 years, risk predictions for patients outside this range represent extrapolation and should be interpreted with caution. Given these statistical limitations, this model should be regarded as an initial proof-of-concept rather than a definitive or validated clinical tool. This first iteration of the calculator, built on single-institution data, represents an initial framework. As such, we welcome scrutiny, external validation, and multi-center collaboration to refine this model, enhance its accuracy and rigor, and expand its applicability to trauma populations beyond our own system.	
In this single-institution analysis investigating patient-specific stroke risk estimates in BCVI, we identified key stroke risk factors and developed a preliminary predictive model for personalized risk assessment. The integration of patient-specific risk-benefit assessments into clinical decision-making will could optimize facilitate the optimal timing of antithrombotic initiation, thereby reducing variability in the administration of antithrombotic therapy. External validation is warranted to enhance and prepare this tool for broader clinical applicability.

 SUPPLEMENTARY METHODS
Using downsampling, weighting, combined downsampling and weighting, and unweighted techniques, the performance of each individual machine learning model was systematically compared based on the ability of the trained model to accurately predict stroke occurrence using cross-validation (CV). Moreover, two separate forms of the data were used for model training. In the first (referred to as the “Simplified” dataset), data on injury laterality were excluded, and the maximum vertebral and carotid injury grades were the only included injury characteristics. In the second dataset (referred to as the “Complete” dataset), data on injury laterality were included, such that the maximum injury grade for the left and right vertebral arteries, the basilar artery, and the left and right carotid arteries were included. Six individual pipelines were constructed to test each method, including generalized additive model (GAM), gradient boosting machine (GBM), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), multilayer perceptron (MLP), Bayesian logistic regression (BLR), and support vector machine (SVM). A random forest pipeline was originally constructed but was excluded from the results due to concerns over reproducibility, likely stemming from issues with inconsistent seeding behavior; however, full implementation details remain available in the source code. Pipelines were all constructed in a similar manner, and a 10-fold CV with 10 separate repeats was performed for each test. GAM and MLP pipelines were fully constructed and run natively in the caret1 package in R. Other pipelines were largely constructed manually and using the glmnet2 (LASSO), arm3 (BLR), xgboost4 (GBM), e10715 (SVM) packages, though some caret-based workflows were used for certain functions in specific pipelines (see associated code in the GitHub repository for further details). The performance metrics (sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating characteristic area under the curve [ROC AUC]) were computed on held-out folds during repeated CV. For each model, the overall performance was summarized by averaging these metrics across all individual folds and repeats. ROC AUC was computed for all pipelines using the pROC6 package as an average across all folds and repeats. ROC curves were generated using pROC; however, this represented a pooled curve from all held-out predictions during repeated CV rather than an “average” curve.
When possible, all iterations of weighting/sampling methods and datasets were used (i.e., eight total iterations [weighting, downsampling, weighting plus downsampling, no weighting] × [complete dataset, simplified dataset]). All eight iterations were implemented in the SVM and GBM pipelines; however, due to technical and statistical limitations, weighting was not feasible in the MLP, and BLR pipelines, and only four iterations of downsampling/no downsampling × complete/simplified datasets were performed. Similarly, technical limitations in the GAM and LASSO only allowed for the use of the simplified dataset; therefore, only two total iterations of downsampling versus no downsampling with the simplified dataset were possible. In total, this resulted in 32 separate sampling/weighting × dataset × model iterations, all of which were systematically compared in their ability to predict stroke risk. It should be noted that while some methods (MLP, GBM, SVM) can implicitly capture interactions between variables, other methods (LASSO, GAM, BLR) require explicit specification of interaction terms. Thus, for the latter three methods, interaction terms between age and key variables, such as age × AT administration, age × vertebral injury grade (maximum and lateralized, as applicable), and age × carotid injury grade (maximum and lateralized, as applicable), were manually specified, in addition to the main effect terms for each of these variables. These were implemented into LASSO, GAM, and BLR as appropriate, and further details on this process can be found in the source code in the GitHub repository.

Uncalibrated risk predictions (before Platt scaling; blue line) and calibrated risk predictions (after Platt scaling; purple line) are compared to the reference line representing perfect calibration (dashed black line). Each data point represents a 10% predicted risk interval (decile). Model calibration was assessed in-sample due to the lack of an external validation cohort.

Risk Stratification and Predictive Performance of the Final LASSO Model. Risk strata were defined based on Platt-scaled (calibrated) predicted stroke probabilities, with observed rates representing actual stroke incidence within each stratum. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) represent classification performance at each risk threshold (≥ 10% for moderate, ≥ 30% for high) applied as a diagnostic cutoff to the entire cohort. The low-risk stratum has no applicable threshold metrics, as a 0% cutoff lacks clinical utility.
